What do you know about the speed of light and the speed of sound? The speed of light is 299792458 m/s. 
Set the speed of light to the variable light, and the speed of sound (343 m/s) to the variable sound.

Using the ternary operator, set the variable lightIsPower true if the speed of light is greater than the speed of sound and false otherwise. 
Print the variable result in the console.
