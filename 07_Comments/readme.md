In JS scripts, there is a way to write pieces of text that will be ignored by the JS interpreter. Such texts are called comments. Why write them at all if in the end they're simply ignored? Well, the interpreter will ignore comments, but other developers won't. Comments allow you to make your code more readable and comprehensible for developers.

JavaScript language supports two types of comments: single-line and multi-line. Let's look at them more closely.

# Single-line comments
Comments that occupy only one line are called single-line comments. Take a careful look at the syntactic features of these comments:
```
console.log("Nice to see you!"); // This code outputs the message to the console
```
In the example above, all text after // is ignored by the interpreter. With the help of such notes, you will quickly remember what a certain code fragment is intended for, even if it's been a while since you last saw it.

# Multi-line comments
Comments that take up several lines are called multi-line comments. These are their syntactic features:
```
/*  
  The following code outputs the message to the console
  The console will display a line with the text "Hello, JS!"
*/
console.log("Hello, JS!");
```
The interpreter ignores all text between /* and the nearest */. Such comments are useful for explaining particularly complex pieces of code or temporarily commenting out code fragments when you need to find an error. Also, multi-line comments located at the beginning of a file are quite useful when you need to specify copyright information.

Sometimes you may find a slightly modified syntax of multi-line notes: the comment opens with the /** tag, and each line starts with an *:
```
/**
* The first program
* Author: Bob  
*/
console.log("Hi, I'm Bob");
```
Such comments often contain information about the programming file including its name, version, and the author of the script.

JavaScript does not support nested comments. This means that you will not be able to write a comment inside another comment.

# Conclusion
Comments make your code more clear and help simplify the work of all those programmers who will work with your code in the future. Comments are also used to temporarily comment out code fragments when you need to find an error. In other words, you can really benefit from comments, so don't ignore them, even though your JS interpreter will. Do not overuse comments, use them wisely, do not forget that comment canâ€™t replace well written code.
