A programming language allows us to explain to a computer how to execute a solution to a particular problem in the real world. But first, a programmer has to come up with the solutions, also using a skill necessary for any type of programming no matter the language. It is called computational thinking.

# What is computational thinking?
Computers can only deal with clear, concise instructions that agree with the rules of formal logic. However, real-world problems are rarely cut so clearly. Computational thinking is a set of mental skills helping to see the problems as a set of complex information processes that we can transform into a particular set of instructions for a computer.

Approach every problem you encounter while learning a programming language as not only the opportunity to remember the syntax of the language but also as an opportunity to train computational thinking.

To do that, you can follow a simple algorithm:

- Describe the problem
What exactly needs to be done? What input data are you given and what does the desired outcome look like?
- Identify the important details needed to solve this problem
Before thinking of a solution, make sure you take into account all the important aspects of the problem. The devil is in the details, and in case of programming, it hides in edge cases.
- Decompose
Break the problem down into small, logical steps until you know exactly how to code each part of it.
- Use these steps to create an algorithm that solves the problem
Connect the pieces of the problem in a way that would produce the desired outcome in all specified cases.
- Evaluate the process
Usually, a problem has at least a few solutions, and itâ€™s very useful to evaluate your idea to make sure you've chosen a way that is as efficient as possible.
