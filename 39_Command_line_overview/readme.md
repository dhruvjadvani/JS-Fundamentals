While working on the computer, you need to communicate with the Operating system (OS) to get things done for you. For example, if you want to open a file, you have to tell the Operating system (Windows, Linux, or macOS) about it. There are two ways of interacting with the OS: one is more verbal while the other is more visual, but both definitely deserve some appreciation. These two methods are the Command-line interface and the Graphical user interface.

# What is the command line?
The command-line interface or CLI is a way to interact with an OS via text commands. On the other hand, the graphical user interface or GUI provides an interface with many icons and menus. Here, you give commands to the operating system by clicking on these icons or menu items.

In the past, command-line interfaces were the only means of interacting with a computer. But why use it now, when you have a simple, familiar graphical interface? Well, generally command-line interfaces are much more flexible and have more options. For example, you can combine commands to create a new one, while you cannot do that via a graphical interface. Some software can even have only a command-line interface, thus requiring its user to know command line basics.

Besides, programs executable by the command-line interface can be written in a command language. They are called shell scripts on UNIX and UNIX-like systems such as GNU/Linux and macOS, and batch files on Windows.

All operating systems have command-line interfaces. Applications may have it as well. Also, modern programming languages provide an interactive command-line mode, in which you execute code line by line.
