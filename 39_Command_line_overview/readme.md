While working on the computer, you need to communicate with the Operating system (OS) to get things done for you. For example, if you want to open a file, you have to tell the Operating system (Windows, Linux, or macOS) about it. There are two ways of interacting with the OS: one is more verbal while the other is more visual, but both definitely deserve some appreciation. These two methods are the Command-line interface and the Graphical user interface.

# What is the command line?
The command-line interface or CLI is a way to interact with an OS via text commands. On the other hand, the graphical user interface or GUI provides an interface with many icons and menus. Here, you give commands to the operating system by clicking on these icons or menu items.

In the past, command-line interfaces were the only means of interacting with a computer. But why use it now, when you have a simple, familiar graphical interface? Well, generally command-line interfaces are much more flexible and have more options. For example, you can combine commands to create a new one, while you cannot do that via a graphical interface. Some software can even have only a command-line interface, thus requiring its user to know command line basics.

Besides, programs executable by the command-line interface can be written in a command language. They are called shell scripts on UNIX and UNIX-like systems such as GNU/Linux and macOS, and batch files on Windows.

All operating systems have command-line interfaces. Applications may have it as well. Also, modern programming languages provide an interactive command-line mode, in which you execute code line by line.

# Learning commands
It's time to learn some important commands. Let's open the command-line interpreter and type some commands. When you open it, you will see something similar to the below text.
```
C:\Users\name>
```
It means that you are in this directory and you can work in the CLI. Now let's try to use it.

Imagine you just woke up on the floor in a room unfamiliar to you. In fact, everything is unfamiliar to you, you don't remember anything, even your name. There's only a computer with the open terminal and this guide, so you decide that it might be helpful to figure something out. So, now you will type your command next to this path.

First, type the whoami and press Enter. Unfortunately, it won't provide you with a deep and satisfying answer about who you really are, but you will see something like this:
```
desktop-qd7c3ju\shanika
```
Good, now you know your name, an imaginary one, at least. As you could already guess, whoami command just returns you the username you used in your machine. That's why you see the above output.

Next, type dir if you use Windows or ls if you use Linux/macOS and press Enter. Both of these commands return the list of files and folders in your current directory. This is one of the most widely used commands by developers especially when they work on servers.

If you have Windows, you will see something similar to the below image.

There's no file that is helpful for your situation. Alas!

Isn't there a command to escape? Yes, there's one. Just type exit and you'll be out... of the command-line interpreter because this command lets you exit it. Good news, you've just learned some useful commands and completed the quest, Shanika! Now you can be free.
