JSON (or JavaScript Object Notation) is a text-based format for storing and transmitting structured data. It comes from the JavaScript language, but it is still considered to be language-independent: it works with almost any programming language. With JSON's lightweight syntax, you can easily store and send to other apps everything from numbers and strings to arrays and objects. You can also create more complex data structures by linking arrays to each other.

# Basic syntax and structure

JSON text can be built on one of two structures:
- a collection of key:value pairs (associative array);
- an orderly set of values (array or list).

JSON objects are written in curly braces {}, and their key:value pairs are separated by a comma ,. The key and the value in the pair are separated by a colon :. Here is an example for you:
```
{
    "first_name": "Sophie",
    "last_name": "Goodwin",
    "age": 34
}
```
