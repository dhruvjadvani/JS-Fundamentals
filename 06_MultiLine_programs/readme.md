# Example
Let's start with an example of such scripts. The following code prints exactly three lines of text, each from a new line:
```javascript
console.log("I");
console.log("know");
console.log("JavaScript");
```
A line break can also be done using the symbol \n:
```javascript
console.log("I\nknow\nJavaScript");
```
The output of these two code samples will be the same:
```
I
know
JavaScript
```
Try running these scripts yourself to see that it works.

# Empty line
The console.log function also allows you to output an empty line without any information in it:
```javascript
console.log("I");
console.log();
console.log("know");
console.log();
console.log("JavaScript");
```
Here's the output:
```
I

know

JavaScript
```
