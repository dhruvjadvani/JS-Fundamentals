# What is the Web?
Have you ever wondered what images will appear in the heads of future generations when it comes to the era in which we live now? It is likely that the 21st century will spark associations with the advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web. Their creation caused major changes not only in the military and science structures but also in the lives of ordinary people, giving us opportunities that previously could only be imagined.

You so often hear phrases like "The World Wide Web has engulfed our planet", that the definition of the Web is naturally pre-assumed and taken for granted. But really, what is this Web and why is it so global?

The World Wide Web is a collection of information resources scattered around the world and linked together by reference. Sometimes this term is shortened to WWW, W3 or simply Web.

The Web is also sometimes ironically called Wild Wild Web by analogy with the movie title Wild Wild West: come to think of it, the resemblance is undeniable.

A unit of hypertext data on the W3 is called a web page. A web page may contain text, media files, graphics and links to other pages.
