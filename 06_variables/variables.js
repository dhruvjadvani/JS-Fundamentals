//Variables declaration
/*
Before you start working with a variable, you need to declare (in other words, create) it. JavaScript uses two keywords to create variables:

let defines a mutable variable the value of which can be changed as many times as needed;
const declares a constant whose value you want to forbid overwriting.
When you declare a variable, you must give it a name after one of these keywords. 
It is good practice to assign a variable name that describes its contents.
Always try to choose meaningful and readable names for variables to make your code easy to understand.
