/*
Often we have to repeat the same action in many parts of the script, for example, summing up different data entered by users each time,
or displaying pop-ups with product descriptions for an online store.

To avoid code duplication and better structure large programs, there are functions.

Functions in JavaScript can be built-in or user-defined, that is, created specifically by the programmer. 
You have already worked with a built-in function console.log().

//Basic Syntax
