# Hello, World!
When learning any programming language, it is a kind of a tradition to start with writing a program that displays a message "Hello, World!" on the screen or on another device. And who are we to break traditions?
```
console.log("Hello, World!");
```
You may run this code: just copy it and click on the triangle. You should get this result:
```
Hello, World!
```
As you can see, the script consists of one line and simply prints the text passed in brackets. Note that the quotes are also ignored when outputting the result. This code is very simple but deserves a detailed review.
