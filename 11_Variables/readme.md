when writing large scale programs it is usually necessary to store data and results of intermediate calculations somewhere. For this purpose variables are used.

# What is a variable
A variable is a named place in memory where you can store data to access it later. It's like a box with a gift inside: this is also a kind of variable!

Every variable has a name to distinguish it from other variables. It is possible to access a value by its variable name.

Variables are one of the most often used elements of programs, so it is important to understand and use them well.
