Execution Context is the most fundamental part of the JavaScript programming language as it describes the internal workings of a JavaScript code. In layman terms, the execution context represents the environment in which our codes run. So there are basically 3 different types of Execution Contexts:

- Global Execution Context
- Local Execution Context
- Eval Execution Context


# Execution Context
An execution context is similar to a container that stores variables, and the code gets evaluated and executed. Thus, it is the execution context that provides an environment for the specific code to get executed. It decides which code section has access to the functions, objects, and variables used in the code.

In JS, we have different types of code, i.e the code is in a global context, local context, or in eval function. Each of these different types of code is evaluated within a dedicated execution context.
