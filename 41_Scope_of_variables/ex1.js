/*
Write a function myFunc() where you create a counter variable i and use it inside the for loop. In the loop, print out all the cubes of numbers from 1 to 5.

Think about which kind of identifier is more appropriate here.

Also, make sure your code defines the function but doesn't call it.

  for(let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i * i * i);
