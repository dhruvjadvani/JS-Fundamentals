These days, it is difficult to find sites that do not allow visitors to interact with them. Think sliders, web galleries, animation and whatever other interactive events that pop out when you press some button. The processing of user input, the ability to send/receive data from servers and other interactive behavior are provided by JavaScript.

# What is JavaScript
JavaScript (JS) is one of the most used programming languages. It was created by Brendan Eich in 1995, and it took him ten days. You read it right: JavaScript was really developed in just ten days!

According to GitHub 2018, JS tops the list of the most popular programming languages. It is used for both front-end and back-end development.

JavaScript is not Java. These are different programming languages. Their similar names were a marketing move to draw attention to the new language and take advantage of the popularity of Java.

JavaScript is based on the ECMAScript standard (often shortened to ES). The latest version of this standard is ES11.

# The first program
Programs written in this language are called scripts. Here is an example of a simple JS script that prints I am starting to learn JavaScript!:

```
console.log("I am starting to learn JavaScript!");
```

All modern browsers have a built-in program that allows you to execute JS directly in them. Let's look at the result of our first program in the browser. To do this, press Ctrl+Shift+J/Ctrl+Shift+K or Cmd+Opt+J/Cmd+Option+C on Mac, write the JS code in the opened console, then press Enter.

As you can see, the result of our first script was the line I am starting to learn JavaScript!.
