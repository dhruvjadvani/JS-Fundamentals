# JS-Fundamentals
JavaScript (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions,
and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well.

There is no character type in javascript!

The function is called anywhere in the file. You can call the function both before and after its creation.

The ability to call a function before its creation is due to the peculiarities of JS file processing by browsers: the browser first goes through the whole code, finds all functions and only then starts executing the code.
