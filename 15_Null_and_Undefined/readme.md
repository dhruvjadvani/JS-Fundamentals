In JavaScript, there are two special data types to indicate the absence of a value: null and undefined. 

# null
null means that the variable was explicitly assigned an empty or non-existent value. If the variable is null, we know that it does not contain an acceptable number, string or other data type:
```
let name = null; 
console.log(name); // null
```
The example above shows that the variable name is unknown or for some reason does not have a value.
